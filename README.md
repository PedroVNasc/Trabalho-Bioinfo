The notebook in this repository uses techniques of pre-processing and feature extraction to attempt to classify different types of sequences of DNA of the plant *Zea mays*. Upon execution, the relevant data is automatically downloaded and cleaned, following which several features are extracted from each given sequence and then a Random Forest algorithm is used for classification.
